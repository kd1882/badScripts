# badScripts - Growing compilation of bash and powershell scripts for daily use

### Not 'bad' bad, just not good, you know... Powered by the robot.

To run powershell scripts, same directory, .\scriptNameHere.ps1 (I can break it down better later...)

Bash scripts, same directory, make file executable -- chmod +x filename.sh --, ./filename.sh. If you want it added so you can access it anywhere in the system, ask the google machine... Just kidding, follow below (Mileage may vary depending on distro)

```
### Move the file
sudo mv /path/to/file /usr/local/bin
### Make file executable
sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/file
### Love the file
file
```

Feel free to reach out or submit an issue for a specific script that you want added. I will start cleaning up the folders here soon so it's not a jumbled nightmare.

Cheers.

## run at your own risk, not liable for you nuking your system.
