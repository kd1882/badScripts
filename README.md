# badScripts - Growing compilation of bash and powershell scripts for daily use

### Not 'bad' bad, just not good, you know... Powered by the robot.

To run powershell scripts, same directory, .\scriptNameHere.ps1 (I can break it down better later...)

Bash scripts, same directory, make file executable -- chmod +x filename.sh --, ./filename.sh (If you want it added so you can access it anywhere in the system, there's stuff with paths I know how to do but don't how to explain, will update later)

run at your own risk, not liable for you nuking your system.
